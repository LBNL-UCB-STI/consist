"""
This module provides utility functions for generating code or data artifacts
based on existing Consist runs or metadata.

Currently, it includes a placeholder for generating SQLModel classes from
tables associated with a specific run.

# consist/tools/generator.py
def generate_models_from_run(run_id: str, output_file: str) -> None:
    """
    Connects to the Consist DuckDB, inspects tables generated by a specific run,
    and generates a Python file containing `SQLModel` classes corresponding to those tables.

    This function aims to facilitate data access and schema definition by
    automating the creation of `SQLModel` definitions based on the actual
    schema of data produced by a Consist run. This is particularly useful
    for building type-safe applications on top of Consist's provenance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    run_id : str
        The unique identifier of the run whose tables should be inspected.
        Only tables directly associated with this `run_id` as outputs will be considered.
    output_file : str
        The path to the Python file where the generated `SQLModel` classes
        will be written. This file will contain class definitions that mirror
        the schema of the run's output tables.
    """
    # 1. Query DuckDB information_schema for tables linked to this run
    # 2. Use `datamodel-code-generator` or simple string templates
    # 3. Write to output_file
